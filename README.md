# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, I was tasked to develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

# What did you do particularly well?
I used multiple files to allow versatile usage and flexibility in the final program. By using headers and separate .cpp files for classes, the code is easy to read and navigate for future collaborations or modifications.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance this code by using less constant values and more flexible variables. For instance, using a vector instead of an array to hold the menu options and a size function to find the number of strings would allow me to add more options down the line without having to edit the constant value.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging pieces of code to write were the functions that modified class objects. By using breakpoints, I was able to see that the assignments were not reflecting outside of the class. After searching for that issue on StackOverflow, I learned how to pass by reference in the function parameter, resolving the issue. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project introduced new concepts, like pass by reference, and scenarios, like using pointers on an array. Having these tools and experiences to pull from when working on future projects and course work allows me to compare new problems and solutions against what I know and make more informed programming decisions.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using easy to read and self explainable naming conventions, industry standard formatting, and frequent comprehensive comments at each important step that explains how and what each section of code is expected to execute.
